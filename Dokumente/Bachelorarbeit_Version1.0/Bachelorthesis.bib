abstract = {Video games are highly engaging environments. Therefore, there is a growing interest in harnessing their motivational potential via game-based learning. However, putting curricular content into digital games is not trivial. Many educational games fail to combine teaching and gameplay in a subtle way, thereby suffer from low-grade design and fail to utilise the motivational potential of video games. This article explicates some main issues of educational games and reflects on an approach to a more informal and harmonic design for educational games. Furthermore, it describes the "Eduventure II", a research project investigating and testing these methods. The game developed in this prototype links the curriculum to narrative, simulation and game play layers. The here presented text describes the theoretical background, issues, concept and implementation of the prototype, as well as the lessons learnt from a pedagogical perspective.},

abstract = {The development of games for people with learning disabilities is one way to enhance the quality of learning and respond to the need for inclusive special educational support. Recently, game researchers have highlighted the need for paying more attention to identifying the game design choices that can strengthen learning. This paper reviews recent studies in the field of games that aim at supporting people with difficulties in learning, particularly in basic reading and maths skills. We identify the major characteristics and learning outcomes of the reviewed studies, as well as key design principles that have been used in games for enhancing basic reading and maths skills. The results show that people with specific learning difficulties have positive improvements in the quality of learning. We also found specific gamification elements that have been used to promote the learning of basic reading and maths skills. However, we call for research, which would explicitly examine the effects of game design choices on learning. Currently, the studies that address learning disabilities do not specifically define which kind of games and game design the results refer to, while game design studies do not clarify how these games influence learning. Thus, there is a need to rethink previous empirical studies on game settings for people with learning difficulties via advancing the role of game design in empirical intervention studies.},

abstract = {Games-based Learning (GBL) has developed a reputation with educationalists it is perceived as a potentially engaging form of supplementary learning that could enhance the educational process and has been used at all levels of education including primary, secondary and tertiary education. Despite this recognition and utilisation there is still a lack of empirical evidence supporting GBL as an approach. This paper presents the findings of a systematic literature review performed from 2000 to 2013 specifically looking at quality empirical studies associated with the application of GBL in Primary Education (PE) categorising studies into: behavioural change, affective and motivational outcomes, perceptual and cognitive skills and knowledge acquisition and content understanding. This paper presents a synthesis of these high quality studies associated with GBL. The studies showed that GBL have been used to teach a variety of subjects to children and young people in PE with mathematics, science, language and social studies being the most popular. However, the analysis shows that more Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) studies should be performed comparing GBL to traditional teaching approaches to ascertain if GBL is a useful, viable teaching approach at PE level; there is a distinct lack of longitudinal studies and further longitudinal studies are required; further studies are required looking at whether there are pedagogical benefits of using 2D or 3D games at PE level to assess if 3D immersive games are indeed necessary; further studies are also required to perform comparisons between single and collaborative play and to identify the pedagogical benefits.},

abstract = {Continuing interest in digital games indicated that it would be useful to update Connolly et al.'s (2012) systematic literature review of empirical evidence about the positive impacts and outcomes of games. Since a large number of papers was identified in the period from 2009 to 2014, the current review focused on 143 papers that provided higher quality evidence about the positive outcomes of games. Connolly et al.'s multidimensional analysis of games and their outcomes provided a useful framework for organising the varied research in this area. The most frequently occurring outcome reported for games for learning was knowledge acquisition, while entertainment games addressed a broader range of affective, behaviour change, perceptual and cognitive and physiological outcomes. Games for learning were found across varied topics with STEM subjects and health the most popular. Future research on digital games would benefit from a systematic programme of experimental work, examining in detail which game features are most effective in promoting engagement and supporting learning.},
